Note On Single Display:

There is a problem caused by playing a game in which it is important for players to conceal their own information/knowledge on a single screen. If all the players are always watching the screen, they will be able to see what cards all the other players have and thereby deduce what the correct solution is to the game. The simple (albeit crude) solution is to instruct all of the players in the game to only look at the screen when input from them is required.
